  abstract  = {We propose a method for estimation of humanoid and human links’ inertial parameters. Our approach formulates the problem as a hierarchical quadratic program by exploiting the linear properties of rigid body dynamics with respect to the inertia parameters. In order to assess our algorithm, we conducted experiments with a humanoid robot and a human subject. We compared ground reaction forces and moments estimated from force measurements with those computed using identfied inertia parameters and movement information. Our method is able to accurately reconstruct ground reaction forces and force moments. Moreover, our method is able to estimate correctly masses of the robots links and to accurately detect additional masses placed on the human subject during the experiments.},
