  abstract  = {We propose a robust method to handle kinematic and algorithmic singularities of any kinematically redundant robot under
task-space hierarchical control with ordered equalities and inequalities. Our main idea is to exploit a second order model
of the nonlinear kinematic function, in the sense of the Newton’s method in optimization. The second order information is provided
by a hierarchical BFGS algorithm omitting the heavy computation required for the trueHessian. In the absence of singularities, which
is robustly detected, we use the Gauss-Newton algorithm that has quadratic convergence. In all cases, we keep a least-squares formulation
enabling good computation performances. Our approach is demonstrated in simulation with a simple robot and a humanoid
robot, and compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.},
