  abstract  = {We propose a new bounding volume that achieves a tunable strict convexity of a given convex hull. This geometric operator is named sphere-tori-patches bounding volume (STP-BV), which is the acronym for the bounding volume made of patches of spheres and tori. The strict convexity of STP-BV guarantees a unique pair of witness points and at least C 1 continuity of the distance function resulting from a proximity query with another convex shape. Subsequently, the gradient of the distance function is continuous. This is useful for integrating distance as a constraint in robotic motion planners or controllers using smooth optimization techniques. For the sake of completeness, we compare performance in smooth and nonsmooth optimization with examples of growing complexity when involving distance queries between pairs of convex shapes.},
