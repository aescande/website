  abstract  = {We study the HRP-2Kai humanoid robot’s ability to conduct the precise industrial task of fastening bolts in aircraft production. Our contribution stands mainly in high integration of different modules within the whole-body Quadratic Programing-based controller that has not been yet confronted to tasks demanding high precision in the execution and tuning. This includes the use of a robust visual servoing algorithm which allows the robot to move autonomously to a desired target and the design of specific tasks and estimators: a learning and admittance control that enables the robot to interact smoothly with its environment, and a fast and safe method to autonomously detect correct tool on nut insertion. We then show that the controller indeed enables our humanoid robot to achieve such a high precision task.}
