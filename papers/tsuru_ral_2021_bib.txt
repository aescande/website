  abstract  = {This paper proposes a framework for an autonomous humanoid robot, aimed at searching for a target object in an unknown environment using 3D-simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The robot determines the next viewpoint in real-time from an environment map and object recognition results, and automatically finds and grasps the target object. Whereas most robot exploration studies require a static map, hints regarding object position, or area size limitations, our system can globally find an occluded object in an unknown environment, based only on the 3D target model. Notably, our robot can predict an unobserved area, and actively reveal it while avoiding obstacles. Our 3D-SLAM approach also estimates a self-camera location in a world coordinate system, so that our robot can re-plan its footsteps while walking, without pause. We validated the efficacy of this method through real experiments with an "HRP2-KAI" in several environments, and achieved fully automated searching and grasping.},
