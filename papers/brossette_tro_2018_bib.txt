  abstract  = {We propose a framework to generate static robot configurations satisfying a set of physical and geometrical constraints.
This is done by formulating nonlinear constrained optimization problems over non-Euclidean manifolds and solving them. To do
so, we present a new sequential quadratic programming solver working natively on general manifolds and propose an interface
to easily formulate the problems, with the tedious and errorprone work automated for the user. We also introduce several new
types of constraints for having more complex contacts or working on forces/torques. Our approach allows an elegant mathematical
description of the constraints and we exemplify it through formulation and computation examples in complex scenarios with
humanoid robots.},
