  abstract  = {For interpolating between elements of SO(n)\nolinebreak , it is attractive to work in so(n)\nolinebreak , passing from one space to the other via the exponential map. However, the logarithm is a multi-valued map and the choice of a particular image affects the quality of the interpolation. In this paper, we propose a fast and accurate algorithm to compute the image that seems the most appropriate for interpolation: given Q in SO(n) and A in so(n)\nolinebreak , our algorithm returns the logarithm of Q which is the closest to A\nolinebreak , under minimal conditions on Q\nolinebreak . We carefully study the mathematical properties of our problem to establish the algorithm, discuss its implementation and demonstrate its efficiency.},
